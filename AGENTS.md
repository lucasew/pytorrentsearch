- **Mise First:** Before doing anything, you MUST install `mise` and use it for all task execution.
- **Real Execution:** Never simulate commands. Run them.
- **Mise Necessity:** `mise` is a non-negotiable basic necessity.
- **Error Handling:** Never ignore errors. You must NEVER leave an empty catch block.
  - **Centralized Error Reporting:** The project MUST have a single, centralized error-reporting function (e.g. `reportError`, `captureException`, or equivalent). All code paths that handle unexpected errors MUST funnel through this function — never call `console.error` or `Sentry.captureException` directly at the call site.
  - **Sentry-aware:** If the project already uses Sentry, the centralized function MUST report to Sentry. If Sentry is not set up, it MUST log the error with enough context (message, stack, relevant metadata). The call site should not know or care which backend is active.
  - **No silent failures:** Every `catch` block, every `.catch()`, every error callback that is not an expected/recoverable condition MUST call the centralized error-reporting function. "Out of scope" is not an excuse to swallow — at minimum, report and move on.
  - **If the function doesn't exist yet:** Create it in the project's shared utilities or services layer, wire it to Sentry if available, and migrate existing scattered `console.error` / `Sentry.captureException` calls to use it.
- **Don't downgrade dependencies**: Don't downgrade dependencies like actions/checkout to v4 or mise action to v2. Don't downgrade anything unless explicitly asked.
- **Focus**: Do your task without trying to be proactive about the surroundings. Do extra things only if asked. You can suggest running minor housekeeping, lints and formats that will be confirmed or rejected in follow up comments. Exception: retroactive violations of known rules are always in scope — see Retroactive Violations First.
- **Negative Memory (Pivot):** Read `.jules/CONSISTENTLY_IGNORED.md` before planning your work. If your intended change matches a pattern listed there, do NOT proceed with it — pivot to a different issue instead. This file records patterns consistently rejected by human reviewers. Use it as a filter, not a dead end: there is always something else worth fixing.
- **Project Conventions:** Read `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` if either exists — these are the project-specific rules and conventions. If both exist, read both, but `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth: consolidate the guidelines from `CLAUDE.md` into `AGENTS.md` as part of your PR. If neither exists and you need to write one, use `AGENTS.md`.
- **Retroactive Violations First:** Read the agent's own journal, the project conventions file, and these directives. If you find existing code that already violates a known rule (e.g. empty catch blocks, patterns in the journal or conventions file), fixing that violation is your first priority — before looking for anything new. The codebase should eat its own dogfood.
- **Codify the Vague:** If you find something inconsistent or ambiguous where no clear rule exists — e.g. two different patterns coexisting without reason — don't just pick one and move on. Write the rule into the project conventions file (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) as part of your PR: what the convention should be and why.
- **Test Beyond Automation:** Passing lint and unit tests is the baseline, not the finish line. After automated checks pass, do a manual sanity check: build the project, trace the code path you changed, think about what a user would actually hit. If it's a web app, does the page render? Does the feature work end-to-end? If you can't verify interactively, at minimum reason through the runtime behavior explicitly — don't assume green CI means the change is safe.
- **Tests Must Earn Their Place:** If you write a test, it must test something you actually implemented or changed — your own logic, your own edge cases. Do not write tests that just exercise external libraries or restate what the library's own tests already cover. A test that doesn't catch a real bug in your code is noise.
